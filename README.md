# graphsense-lib

[![Test and Build Status](https://github.com/graphsense/graphsense-lib/actions/workflows/run_tests.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/graphsense/graphsense-lib/actions)

A central repository for python utility functions and everything that deals with the graphsense backend. Its CLI interface can be used to control important graphsense maintainance tasks.

## Use

### As a library

Access the graphsense cassandra db. This requires a graphsense config (see Modules/Config)
```python3
from graphsenselib.db import DbFactory

with DbFactory().from_config(env, currency) as db:
    print(db.transformed.get_highest_block())
```

Alternatively, the database can also be accessed without relying on the graphsense config file.
```python
from graphsenselib.db import DbFactory

with DbFactory().from_name(
        raw_keyspace_name="eth_raw",
        transformed_keyspace_name="eth_tranformed",
        schema_type="utxo",
        cassandra_nodes = ["test.cassandra1", "test.cassandra2"]
    ) as db:
    print(db.transformed.get_highest_block())
```

### From the commandline.

Graphsenslib exposes a commandline interface - graphsence-cli.

Help can be viewed by:
```bash

```

## Install

To install run

```bash
make install
```
or
```bash
pip install .
```

## Development


it is advised to use a virtual environment (venv) for development. Run the following command to initialize one
```bash
    > python3 -m venv .venv
```

and activate it (in bash) using

```bash
    > source .venv/bin/activate
```
 For more information refer to ([venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)). Run

```bash
    > make dev
```

to initialize the dev environment.
If you want to install graphsenselib in development mode run

```bash
    > make install-dev
```

Before committing anything to the repository please format, lint and test your code in that order. Fix all linter warnings and make sure all test are passing before a commit.

Use the following commands for that:
```bash
    > make format
    > make lint
    > make test
```

or equivalently run
```bash
    > make pre-commit
```

Some slow tests are excluded when running make test. Occasionally, one should run
```bash
    > make test-all
```

to run the entire test-suite.

Linting and formatting should be automatically executed on every git commit, using pre-commit.

To create the documentation please run:
```bash
    > make docs
```

Creating the docs need python dev dependencies to build see ([Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21530577/fatal-error-python-h-no-such-file-or-directory}))

### Tagging a release

To tag a new release please update the changelog first. Afterwards, update the Version numbers RELEASESEM and RELEASE in the main Makefile.```

To apply the tags run
```bash
    > make tag-version
```
